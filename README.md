# Internshala Machine Learning Project

## Project: Property Price Prediction

This project aims to predict property prices based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and other factors. It uses machine learning regression techniques to build a model that estimates the price of a property based on these factors.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about properties, such as:
- Area (in square feet)
- Location (categorical data)
- Number of bedrooms
- Age of the property
- Other relevant features

The dataset is typically stored in a CSV format, and preprocessing steps are done to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swastiswagat/Internshala-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Internshala-Machine-Learning
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## How to Run the Project

Prepare the dataset:
Place the dataset in the data/ directory or adjust the file path in the code accordingly.
Run the script to train the model and make predictions:
```bash
  python Property\ Price\ Prediction.ipynb
